    <h1>Printing</h1>
      <p><em>Printing</em> is a process for reproducing text and images using a master form or template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing include cylinder seals and objects such as the Cyrus Cylinder and the Cylinders of <em class="names">Nabonidus</em>. The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was <strong class="method">woodblock printing</strong>, which appeared in China before 220 <abbr aria-label="Anno Domini">AD</abbr>.<sup>[1]</sup> Later developments in printing technology include the <strong class="method">movable type</strong> invented by <em class="names">Bi Sheng</em> around 1040 <abbr aria-label="Anno Domini">AD</abbr> <sup>[2]</sup> and the printing press invented by <em class="names">Johannes Gutenberg</em> in the 15th century. The technology of printing played a key role in the development of the Renaissance and the scientific revolution, and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.</p>
    <h1>History</h1>
    <h2>Woodblock printing</h2>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing"><em>Woodblock printing</em></a> is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on textiles and later on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 <abbr title="Anno Domini">AD</abbr></p>

    <h3>In East Asia</h3>
      <p>The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 <abbr aria-label="Anno Domini">AD</abbr>). They are the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper and appeared in the mid-seventh century in China.</p>

      <p>By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the Diamond Sutra (British Library) of 868.<sup>[4]</sup> By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.<sup>[5]</sup></p?>

        <p>Printing spread early to Korea and Japan, which also used Chinese logograms, but the technique was also used in Turpan and Vietnam using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia.<sup>[6]</sup> This technique was transmitted to Europe via the Islamic world, and by around 1400 was being used on paper for old master prints and playing cards.<sup>[7]</sup>] However, Arabs never used this to print the Quran because of the limits imposed by Islamic doctrine.<sup>[6]</sup></p>

    <h3>In the Near East</h3>
      <p><strong class="method">Block printing</strong>, called tarsh in Arabic, developed in Arabic Egypt during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and amulets. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly tin, lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the Muslim world. Though Europe adopted <strong class="method">woodblock printing</strong> from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of <strong class="method">metal block printing<strong> remained unknown in Europe. <strong class="method">Block printing</strong> later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after <strong class="method">movable type printing</strong> was introduced from China.<sub>[8]</sub></p>

    <h3>In Europe</h3>

      <p><strong class="method">Block printing</strong> first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the technique transferred very quickly to small woodcut religious images and playing cards printed on paper. These prints produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.</p>

      <p>Around the mid-fifteenth-century, block-books, woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with <strong class="method">movable type</strong>. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the Ars moriendi and the Biblia pauperum were the most common. There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of <strong class="method">movable type</strong>, with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.<sub>[9]</sub></p>

    <h2>Movable-type printing</h2>
      <p><strong class="method">Movable type</strong> is the system of printing and typography using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from matrices struck by letterpunches. <strong class="method">Movable type</strong> allowed for much more flexible processes than <strong class="method">hand copying</strong> or <strong class="method">block printing.</strong></p>

      <p>Around 1040, the first known <strong class="method">movable type</strong> system was created in China by Bi Sheng out of porcelain.<sub>[2]</sub> Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but Wang Zhen by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained <strong class="method">woodblock printing (xylography)</strong>, which "proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters".<sub>[10]<sub></p>

      <p><strong class="method">Copper movable type printing</strong> originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money issued by the Northern Song dynasty. <strong class="method">Movable type</strong> spread to Korea during the Goryeo dynasty.</p>

      <p>Around 1230, Koreans invented a <strong class="method">metal type movable printing</strong> using bronze. The Jikji, published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished.<sub>[11]</sub> The Korean form of <strong class="method">metal movable type</strong> was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to <strong class="method">Gutenberg's".<sub>[12]</sub> Eastern metal movable type<strong class="method"></strong> was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and the early 15th century.<sub>[6][13][14][15][16]</sub></p>
